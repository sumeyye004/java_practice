methods

	methods are important for programming. They help you create reusable code. Readable , maintainable code.


public class Test{


	public static void main(String[] args){
		greet();
	}

	public static void greet() {
		System.out.println("Good Morning");
		System.out.println("How are you today?");
	}
}

	public static String hello(int n){
		return "world";
	}

	public static void main(String[] args){
		String str = hello(4);
		System.out.println(hello(4));
	}

return type

	void: runs some code and nothing is returned from the method
	return type: runs some code and returns a single value back

	if a method defines a return type instead of void, then there MUST be a return value.
		-> The return value is given using the 'return' keyword

	when calling a return method it is up to you how you will use the return value

parameters/arguments

    parameters are information needed for a method to run. That information is used in the method
        you can define as many parameters as needed

    Q: What is the difference between parameter and argument
            parameter: the variables declared and used in the method

            argument: the value given when calling a method

method overloading

	method has the same name, but different parameters (parameter datatypes can be changed or the number of parameters)

		-> allow us to have different methods that share a similar idea and work with different inputs
			+ readability
			+ re-usability

    return type DOES NOT overload your method
        you need to overload the method by changing the parameters
            -> BUT IF the method is overloaded THEN you can change the return type
                -> Return type can be the same or different if overloaded

	IQ: Can you overload a main method?
		Yes, we can add a new method with name main, and have different parameters, but it will not act as the normal main method
